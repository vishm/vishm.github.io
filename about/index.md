## Introduction

I am Vish Murden, a long time technology enthusiast whose journey began at a tender age with the receipt of a [Sinclair ZX81](http://www.imarshall.karoo.net/zx81/). 
Typing in copious amounts of code into the computer was my first introduction to the wonderful world of software programming in which endless opportunities exists to morph the hardware to do onesâ€™ bidding, mwah ha ha.

So yes, I have been in technology for a long time now, but I still get those same feelings just as I did when coding the ZX81 when I see some new cool technology. I feel quite fortunate to be living is this era where I have seen technology evolve. I enjoy continuing learning about new technologies and methodologies as they surface (or as is sometimes the case, re-surfacing).

I have been lucky to be able to make a living from what was a hobby. In my time I have been proud to ship many great consumer products and bespoke systems that have added value to the the end users computing experience. Getting positive feedback from clients is where I get my buzz as I feel this is core to what we do as technology folk, we are evolving the user space with better experiences.

## Skills

Over the years I have amassed a wide variety of technical skills across many languages, technologies and operating system. My core skills are in product development, but like many technology enthusiast, I have had a hand in general IT infrastructure support activities.

As time has shown me, technical skills is not enough to ship good products & solutions. Two additional skillset that have grown with time, are my inter personal skills and sound business acumen.

Great inter personal skills is key to successful product deliveries. The ability to work with others of diverse/broad skillset, home in on a solution, mentoring those less experience colleagues, moving past those roadblocks, providing a clear vision and roadmap for the future are key. Ensuring a first class working environment will always allow one to extract the best out of people. 

Certainly over my career history, I can see how my improved business acumen has driven me to delivering compelling products/solutions to the user base. Knowing where to invest time, knowing when a particular use-case will take a product in a direction with greater cost consequences in future is a skillset I have developed through my many real world experiences.

## Consulting

I am available to consult on all aspects of product development. From product planning, technical strategy & development through to ensuring an engaging and friction free development process.

Welcome to my blog, it has been a long time coming. I'm a technology enthusiast and 
especially enjoy creating and shipping solutions that make others more productive. 
In this blog I hope to capture some stories from the battle field of software development
in the real world, as well as writing up about any new technology developments that interest me.

I hope the contents will be of use to others as well as a store for my notes when my memory fails me.

##So the blogging journey begins…

Figuring out which technology to use and host for this blog was my first port of call. I looked at different blogging platforms, however, I took a shine to Wordpress as this seems to be widely used for technical blogs and has a large community behind it that supply all manner of plugin.

With my mind made up, I installed and spun up a WordPress instance on clean cloud hosted virtual machine. All looked promising, I even purchased the specular looking [Theme X](http://themeforest.net/item/x-the-theme/5871901).  It was all looking very good, some new technology exposure to WordPress and PHP, this was right up my street. However, I was aware of my rough and ready WordPress setup hosted on a virtual machine backed by a local MySQL instance was not really going to cut the mustard long term.

The next point of call was to simply understand how I’d go about moving my site onto something more official when the need arose, and this is when things became to get a little a complicated due to WordPress’s setup of having state spread across the file system and MySQL. I’m sure there are valid reasons for this, and there are various web sites detailing backup/migration approaches. On reading the various documents and reviewing my own setup, I had to sensibly call into question my intended use of WordPress with respect to my blogging effort as the documents I read conveyed quite a complex migrations & backup process.

I was recommended to look at GitHub Pages and the underlying [Jekyll]( http://jekyllrb.com) system as a way of building my blog. It is not as fancy as WordPress, but it is a pretty powerful system with sufficient features for blogging. It allows me to easily compose pages, maintain backups, rollback changes etc It is still early days, but so far so good. There are aspect of the site I’d like to refine visually, such changes will come online in due course and I look forward to a new learning exercise.
